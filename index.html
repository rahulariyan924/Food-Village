       <p>All recipes are not created equal. Some recipes have missing ingredients, faulty seasonings, insufficient or poor instructions causing more work, and some are simply not tested . A standardized recipe is a set of written instructions used to consistently prepare a known quantity and quality of food for a specific location. A standardized recipe will produce a product that is close to identical in taste and yield every time it is made, no matter who follows the directions.</p>

                              <p>It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in butter, garlic and thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter does all sorts of wonderful things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to the crust of the steak.</p>

                              <p>Traditionally, this is a slow-cooked dish. So, whenever you opt to make Hyderabadi Haleem, try to cook it in handi and over slow flame.
                              Try to use a little rice in the dish, as it will provide starch to your Haleem and bind it nicely.</p>
